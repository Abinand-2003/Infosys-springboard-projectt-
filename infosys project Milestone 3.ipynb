      "Recommendations:\n",
      "For Abinand and his friends, a personalized luxury hotel experience should balance their business trip needs with their desire for relaxation and social interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommended Amenities:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Rooftop Bar & Lounge:**  This directly aligns with Abinand's preference for a luxurious rooftop bar.  It offers a sophisticated ambiance, potentially with live music (check if the hotel has a musician schedule), creating a space conducive to both socializing with friends and potentially networking with colleagues.  This could be supplemented with curated cocktail and bar snacks for those late-night networking opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Outdoor Pool Area (with a badminton court):**  While the hotel has many choices, if it's available, a dedicated badminton court will be a game-changer. It offers a fun and active way for the group to spend their downtime, and allows the hotel staff to anticipate their desire for activity.  A nicely-designed pool area with comfortable seating and potentially a small lounge for post-match relaxation adds to the leisure aspect and caters to their social nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommended Dining Style:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chinese Fusion Restaurant:**  Given the preference for non-vegetarian and Chinese cuisine, a restaurant specializing in Chinese fusion would be ideal. This would offer innovative Chinese dishes, potentially with some locally-inspired or international-fusion elements, ensuring a culinary adventure for the young and exciting group.  It allows them to explore new flavours without being overly adventurous. This offers a sophisticated dining experience, especially if the hotel's own staff can offer additional suggestions of dishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Personalized Touches (to elevate the experience):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Early Check-In:**  If their flight allows, offering an early check-in would be extremely appreciated.  This will enable them to use their time effectively, explore the hotel before the rest of the business commitments, and unwind before the hustle.\n",
      "* **Welcome amenity:** A personalized welcome basket (with a curated selection of artisanal teas and local snacks, perhaps with a few badminton/sport-related goodies).  This demonstrates a level of care and shows their needs were considered and preempted.\n",
      "* **Digital concierge:** Access to the hotel's digital concierge for requests, recommendations, and real-time information about activities/restaurants in the area. This will also include details on nearby badminton courts.\n",
      "* **Dedicated check-in and check-out:** Offering a separate, slightly faster check-in and check-out process, particularly for returning guests to expedite their return from the day's business meetings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "By combining these amenities, dining options, and personalized touches, the hotel can deliver a memorable and highly enjoyable experience for Abinand and his friends, ensuring their business trip stays luxurious and enjoyable.\n",
