      "Recommendations:\n",
      "For this discerning couple, I recommend focusing on a **sophisticated and luxurious experience** that blends relaxation, culinary indulgence, and vibrant nightlife.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Amenity Recommendation 1:  Upscale Spa & Wellness Center**\n",
      "\n",
      "A spa with a strong emphasis on personalized treatments, perhaps featuring a dedicated couple's suite or a private hydrotherapy experience, would be highly appealing.  This goes beyond a basic spa; it needs to offer premium services like aromatherapy, specialized massages (couples massages, perhaps), and high-end skincare products.  Consider a spa that integrates elements of mindfulness, like meditation rooms or yoga studios.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Amenity Recommendation 2 (Secondary):  A Chic Rooftop Bar/Lounge**\n",
      "\n",
      "A sophisticated rooftop bar with panoramic views, offering curated cocktails, premium wines, and an elegant ambiance, is an excellent addition.  Live music (jazz or acoustic) would elevate the experience further. This provides an ideal space for pre-dinner drinks and a sophisticated nightlife option.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dining Recommendation:  Fine-Dining Restaurant with Tasting Menus**\n",
      "\n",
      "A fine-dining restaurant known for its sophisticated tasting menus and expertly crafted, non-vegetarian dishes is a must. The restaurant should possess a stunning interior design, impeccable service, and a wine list that complements the menu.  A focus on locally-sourced ingredients would be a bonus.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why this combination works:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Luxury:** The spa, rooftop bar, and fine dining restaurant all cater to a desire for luxury and exclusivity.\n",
      "* **Relaxation and Wellness:** The spa directly addresses the guest's interest in spa and wellness activities.\n",
      "* **Nightlife and Culture:** The rooftop bar offers a sophisticated nightlife option, and the fine dining experience provides an element of cultural immersion.\n",
      "* **Non-Vegetarian Preference:**  The fine-dining restaurant caters directly to this requirement.\n",
      "* **Couple's Trip:**  The spa experience and shared dining can be tailored to creating intimate moments for the couple.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach provides a holistic experience, blending relaxation with excitement and allowing the couple to indulge in their shared interests in a luxurious and memorable way.\n",
